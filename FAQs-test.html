    <dt><a href="">A new website?! What's that cost? </a></dt>
    <dd>Investing in your business can seem overwhelming, we hope to take the mystery and stress out of that. The first step in building a new site is always a totally free ‘getting to know you phase’ through a form and 20 ~ 30 min video/phone consultation. From there we send each potential client an in depth proposal that gives you three options so everyone can find something that suits their needs and budget. And to give you a more direct number as we always appreciate folx being upfront our starting price point for a basic site is $1,850.</dd>

    <dt><a href="">Branding? Like a logo?</a></dt>
    <dd>A brand is so much more than a logo, it is the entire look & feel of your company. Although, people know not to judge a book by its cover, let’s be honest, we all do and your brand is no different. Make sure you have a cover that stands above the rest! We do logos, but we also create brand strategies, style guidelines, and other graphic elements to really capture your brand's vibe.</dd>

    <dt><a href="">What is SEO? And why do I need it?</a></dt>
    <dd>Search Engine Optimization is the great mystery of the interwebs, but we love to try and solve that rubix cube for you. Basically, it’s great to have a website and all, but if no one can find you through a simple search your traffic and ability to attract new clients will not increase. That is where SEO comes in. We’ll go through your site and tweak/add keywords, meta data, and other elements likely to improve your searchability.</dd>

    <dt><a href="">How can I utilize illustrations & animations?</a></dt>
    <dd>Custom designed illustrations and animations can do so much to give your brand a real personality on websites, social media, and print layouts. We can do a la carte projects or create a specialized graphic element pack just for you! </dd>

    <dt><a href="">What's Custom Code?</a></dt>
    <dd>Custom code means your future website is truly unique to you and can’t be found anywhere else on the interwebs. Whether we are building your site from scratch, Square Space, Shopify, or from one of our own templates we make sure each site has a little something coded just for it.</dd>
