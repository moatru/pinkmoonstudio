  <!-- QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ACCORDIAN -->
  <!-- dl stands for description list, with a description title and a description description -->
  <dl class="col-11 accordion light-bg padded-1">

    <dt><a href="">A new website?! What's that cost? </a></dt>
    <dd>Investing in your business can seem overwhelming, we hope to take the mystery and stress out of that. The first step in building a new site or refreshing what you’ve got always starts with a totally free ‘getting to know you phase’ through a form and 20 ~ 30 min video/phone consultation. From there we send each potential client a proposal that gives you a clear vision for our scope of work and pricing.</dd>

    <dt><a href="">Branding? Like a logo?</a></dt>
    <dd>A brand is so much more than a logo, it is the entire look & feel of your company. Although, people know not to judge a book by its cover, let’s be honest, we all do and your brand is no different. Make sure you have a cover that stands above the rest! We do basic brand stratigies for all our web projects and can create logos, illustrations, animations, or gifs as well to really capture your brand's vibe.</dd>

    <dt><a href="">How can I utilize illustrations & animations?</a></dt>
    <dd>Custom designed illustrations and animations can do so much to give your brand a real personality on websites, social media, and print layouts. We can do a la carte projects or create a specialized graphic element pack just for you! </dd>

    <dt><a href="">What's Custom Code?</a></dt>
    <dd>Custom code means your future website is truly unique to you and can’t be found anywhere else on the interwebs. Whether we are building your site from scratch or using a platform like SquareSpace, or from one of our own templates we make sure each site has a little something coded just for you to make sure it is meeting all your design & functionality dreams. </dd>
