  <!-- QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ACCORDIAN -->
  <!-- dl stands for description list, with a description title and a description description -->
  <dl class="col-11 accordion light-bg padded-1">

    <dt><a href="">A new website?! What's that cost? </a></dt>
    <dd>Investing in your business can seem overwhelming, we hope to take the mystery and stress out of that. The first step in building a new site or refreshing what you’ve got  always starts with a totally free ‘getting to know you phase’ through a form and 20 ~ 30 min video/phone consultation. From there we send each potential client an in depth proposal that gives you a clear vision for our scope of work and pricing. Also we make sure our Glow Up & Template packages are as straightforward as possible with a flat rate of $500. </dd>

    <dt><a href="">Branding? Like a logo?</a></dt>
    <dd>A brand is so much more than a logo, it is the entire look & feel of your company. Although, people know not to judge a book by its cover, let’s be honest, we all do and your brand is no different. Make sure you have a cover that stands above
      the rest! We do logos, but we also create brand strategies, style guidelines, and other graphic elements to really capture your brand's vibe.</dd>

    <dt><a href="">What is SEO? And why do I need it?</a></dt>
    <dd>Search Engine Optimization is the great mystery of the interwebs, but we love to try and solve that rubix cube for you. Basically, it’s great to have a website and all, but if no one can find you through a simple search your traffic and
      ability to attract new clients will not increase. That is where SEO comes in. We’ll go through your site and tweak/add keywords, meta data, and other elements likely to improve your searchability.</dd>

    <dt><a href="">How can I utilize illustrations & animations?</a></dt>
    <dd>Custom designed illustrations and animations can do so much to give your brand a real personality on websites, social media, and print layouts. We can do a la carte projects or create a specialized graphic element pack just for you! </dd>

    <dt><a href="">What's Custom Code?</a></dt>
    <dd>Custom code means your future website is truly unique to you and can’t be found anywhere else on the interwebs. Whether we are building your site from scratch or using a platform like SquareSpace, Shopify, or from one of our own templates we make sure each site has a little something coded just for you to make sure it is meeting all your design and functional needs. </dd>
