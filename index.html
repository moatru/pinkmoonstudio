        <p><b>Pink Moon Studio is a project that is still in the beginning phase of blooming.</b> <br>While we were planning on launching our site next month, we felt there was no better time than now to offer our services if they could help folks needing a platform to lift their voices. We can't wait to share our full site next month and to help where we can in the meantime.</p>

      <p class="emphasis"> If you are a Black artist, organizationer, or just need a website contact us at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pinkmoonstudioflow/?hl=en" target="_blank">@pinkmoonstudioflow </a>or <a href="mailto:info@pinkmoon-studio.com">info@pinkmoon-studio.com </a> and we can make something for you at no cost.</p>

      <p class="emphasis">We can also offer branding, graphic design, and motion graphics services. If you know someone who could use a website, please share! </p>

        <p><strong>*Update*</strong> We've had a lot of people reach out and, as a team of two, we are trying to be realistic with our clients about what's doable within the requested time frames while still being thorough with each website. At the moment, we can't take on any new clients but will have a waitlist and begin taking on new projects in August. We want to make doing free sites an ongoing part of our practice and this seems the best way to do it. If your project is urgent, we can try and connect you with other designers. Thank you for your patience and please reach out so we can add you to our list! </p>
